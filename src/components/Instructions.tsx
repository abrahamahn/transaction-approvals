          </h1><br />I wanted to let you know that I've finished all the necessary bug fixes and added some extra touches to improve the overall look and feel of the project. Unfortunately, bug #7 was not addressed on the fix due to time constraints. <br /><br />However, I made sure that CSS aligns everything with Ramp's brand identity and took inspiration from the company website to make some additional tweaks. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.
