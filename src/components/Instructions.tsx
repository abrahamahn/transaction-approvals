          </h1><br />I wanted to let you know that I've finished all the necessary bug fixes and added some extra touches to improve the overall look and feel of the project. <br /><br />I even made sure to align everything with Ramp's brand identity and took inspiration from their website to make some additional tweaks. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.
